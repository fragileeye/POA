## Description of the folds:
+ compare_attack_detection: results of comparing POA and FOA.
+ compare_seg_mgmt: codes and results of table segmentation exp.
+ compare_rule_replace: codes and results of flow eviction exp, and the pcap files used to conduct the exp.
+ compare_detection: codes and results of attack detection exp.
+ resources: codes and results of resources assumption exp.
+ data_txt: organized experimental results stored in txt files.
+ figs: figures generated by draw.ipynb.

## Notice:
